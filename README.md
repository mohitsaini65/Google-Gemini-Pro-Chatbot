# Streamlit Chatbot using Gemini API

This project is a simple web-based chatbot built using **Streamlit** and **Google’s Gemini API**. It provides a clean chat interface where users can interact with an AI assistant in real time.

The application maintains chat history using Streamlit session state and displays messages in a conversational layout similar to popular messaging apps.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to understand how to integrate large language models into a lightweight web application. The chatbot accepts user input, sends it to the Gemini model, and displays the generated response instantly.

Custom CSS is used to improve the UI and create a clear distinction between user and bot messages.
